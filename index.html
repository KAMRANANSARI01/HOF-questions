                   // QUESTION-1
                  //  The problem is to create a program that uses the setTimeout() function to reverse a given string after a delay of 2 seconds. The program should use a variable “input” storing a string as input and then implement a delay of 2 seconds before reversing the string. The reversed string should then be printed as output.

                  let input = 'Hello World'
                  let reverseStr = (str)=>{
                      return str.split("").reverse().join("");
                  }
                  setTimeout(()=>{
                      let output = reverseStr(input);
                      console.log(output);
                  },2000);

                  // QUESTION - 2
                  // Random Number Generator with Delay and Progress Indication:
                  The goal of this program is to generate a random number after a delay of 3 seconds, and store the delay in a variable so can be modified. The program displays a message every second indicating the time remaining until the random number is generated and then outputs the generated number.
